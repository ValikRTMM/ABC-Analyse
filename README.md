# ABC-Analyse
Welcome to my very b̲e̲g̲i̲n̲n̲e̲r̲-level project. The first one I've shared on GitHub. I was scared haha. 
This project actually just automates a school assignment, so if you're in Germany with a similar task, feel free to use this code)!  But for normal people this program has no value, which I really regret and will fix this one in future projects. 
It's part of my learning journey, and I aim to create more meaningful projects in the future.


[⚠️] If it is your pleasure to notice any advice and you find a spare 5 minutes in your busy schedule to make a commit, I would be incredibly grateful for this.

## How it works 
1.  Table1: Visualizes basic product data like product number, quantity, and price.

2.  Table2: Introduces calculations like worth, share of total quantity, share of total worth, and rank.

3.  Table3: Builds upon Table2 with cumulative calculations and categories (A, B, C) based on the share of total worth.


## How it use 
1.  pip install tabulate
2.  Run abc_analyse.py
3.  Follow instructions
